# React useState Hook

The `useState` Hook is a fundamental React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to add state to your functional components without converting them to class components.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything separately to use `useState` in your React project. It's included in React by default.

## Usage

### Importing useState

In your React component file, you can import `useState` like this: import React, { useState } from 'react'

## Benefits
Simplifies state management in functional components.
Reduces the need for class components in React applications.

## Considerations
Each call to useState creates a separate state variable. Be mindful of managing too many state variables in a component.

Happy coding with useState in React!
